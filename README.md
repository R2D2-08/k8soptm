# Optimizing Cluster Management

This repository outlines the approach taken to optimize cluster management, predict pod failures and further decrease downtime.

## Phase 1: Prediction
Phase 1 of this project involves the use of an AI model to predict the following:
- Pod failures
- Resource exhaustion
- Network & connectivity issues
- Service Disruption
To achieve this we split the phase into a set of sub-phases:
### Data collection for training
### Data Pre-Processing
### Training the model
### Testing the model
### Re-train and Re-test with different models
### Anomaly detection based approach
### Finalize the model
### Create a pipeline 
### Additionally incorporate the ability to re-train over incoming data
### Containerize
## Phase 2: Remediation
